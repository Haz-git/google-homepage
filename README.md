Hello,

This will be my first webpage assignment from The Odin Project. It's basicallly a static clone of Google.com without any functionality nor features. The idea is to learn basic html and css instruction and how to format stuff around the webpage. It'll also teach me how to use developer tools and problem solve by searching for answers by myself. This is the beginning of another branch of my journey to become a software engineer.
